# Collaboration

An edit made by the collaborator.

I am a collaborator!

This is a change I am making on a new branch and not directly on the master
branch.

git-flow is an extension of working with branches.

After you make a pull request, you don't have to resubmit it.

This is a change without running `git pull upstream development` first.
